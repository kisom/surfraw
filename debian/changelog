    <surfraw-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>" to the list of copyright holders.

  * Makefile.am: Added missing files to EXTRA_DIST
  * Added a debconf note (only visible if upgrading from 2.0-1)
    explaining the elvi have moved again.

    specified minimum automake version 1.7
  * updated surfraw.lsm with new URLs
  * deleted debian/rules.save (old rules backup)
  * Removed elvi:
    + britannica: gone subscription-only
    + swhois: all whois sites I can find have anti-harvester features
	  that stop us using them (Closes: #231939).
  * Fixed elvi:
    + wikipedia - added missing quotes (could've sworn I did this already)
    + cnn - updated url
    + translate - corrected docs
  * Moved debian/surfraw.links to links.IN in top dir, now uses autoconf
    and is not debian-specific
  * Makefile.am: Added install-data-hook to create links
  * configure.in, elvi/Makefile.in: fixed ELVIDIR quoting
  * Added elvi/surfraw_elvi to CLEANFILES & removed it from cvs, as it is
    generated on build.
  * Disabled ifs quoting in elvi that don't like it: 
    freedb, happypenguin, jake, rhyme, scaleplus, sharereactor
    thesaurus, webster, deblists.
  * Added note to HACKING explaining how to disable ifs quoting
  * Synced NAMESPACE branch with HEAD
    Please use the main HEAD branch from now on.
  * links.IN: made links relative
  * Converted debconf to po-debconf
  * Eliminated templates.IN, as it confused po-debconf
  * Deautoconfiscated the debian directory, as only templates went through
    autoconf
