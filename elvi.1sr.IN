.SH DESCRIPTION

This is the man page for the elvi, a set of search tools that
form part of \fBsurfraw(1)\fP.

Surfraw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety
of popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It
reclaims google, altavista, dejanews, freshmeat, research index,
slashdot and many others from the false\(hyprophet, pox\(hyinfested
heathen lands of html\(hyforms, placing these wonders where they
belong, deep in unix heartland, as god loving extensions to the
shell.

To search using this elvis, do:

 sr elvisname [options] search terms.

For example, to search google for information on Debian ports,
using the "I'm feeling lucky" option:

 sr google \-l debian ports

To find out about options specific to this elvis, do:

 sr elvisname \-local\-help

To find out about surfraw, see the man page for surfraw(1).
To see the full list of elvi, do:

 sr \-elvi

.SS Adding the elvi to your path

If you are a regular user of surfraw, you will probably get sick
of typing sr or surfraw each time. You can regain the old
behaviour of running the elvi directly by adding the elvi
directory (\%@ELVIDIR@) to your path, either manually or using
\fBsurfraw\-update\-path(1)\fP.

.SH OPTIONS

Use	\fB\%sr elviname \-local-help\fP for elvi\(hyspecific options.

The following options work with all elvi.

.TP
.B \-help
Show summary of options (including elvi\(hyspecific options).

.TP
.B \-local-help
Show elvi\(hyspecific options.

.TP
.B \-version
Show version of program.

.TP
\fB\-browser=\fP\fIEXECUTABLE\fP
Set browser (default: sensible\-browser).

.TP
.B \-elvi
Display a list of other Surfraw mechanisms for conquering evil.

.TP
.B \-escape\-url\-args=yes|no
Apply url escaping to arguments (default: yes)

.TP
.B \-q|\-quote
Bracket arguments with " characters (default: no)
Note that putting quotes round arguments works now, so you can do,
for example:

 sr google foo "bar baz" bam

and the quoting is passed on to the search engine

.SH EXAMPLES

 $ sr ask why is jeeves gay?
 $ surfraw google \-results=100 RMS, GNU, which is sinner, which is sin?
 $ sr austlii \-method=phrase dog like
 $ @ELVIDIR@/rhyme \-method=perfect Julian
