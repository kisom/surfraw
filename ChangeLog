	  + S - search using w3_custom_search.
	* google: -g for groups clashed with -g for graphical browser.

	* alioth: changed test to SKIP:, works OK but won't talk
	  to LWP, hence test breaks.
	* discogs, openbsd: fixed tests.
	* mdn, mysqldoc, pgdoc, phpdoc: added tests.
	* w3_custom_search:
	  + document in README.
	  + remove documentation for ixquick support.

	  + add -custom-search= commandline option.
	* updated copyright years to 2013.

2013-09-30  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* new elvi: mdn, mysqldoc, pgdoc, phpdoc
	* new function: w3_custom_search
	  Is used by elvi that use a generic search engine with (eg) site:
	  or inurl: to narrow down the search.
	  Pass it -s=site -u=url for site: and inurl: args
	  plus the quoted search args
	* new environment variable: SURFRAW_customsearch_provider
	  to set provider used by w3_custom_search
	  can be set to: google, duckduckgo or ixquick.
	  Currently affects: mysqldoc, netbsd(*), openbsd(*), pgdoc,
	  phpdoc, mysqldoc.

	  + added -ml and -mv to show message id links and list view.

2012-06-27  Thomas Zervogiannis <tzervo@gmail.com>

	* Added searchable bookmarks

	  + Bookmarks can now be searchable by adding '%s' to
	    the url string.

2012-06-01  Jason Ryan	<jasonwryan@surfraw.org>

	* New elvi: github (search github.com)

2012-03-17  Ivy Foster  <joyfulgirl@archlinux.us>

2011-10-10  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* surfraw.IN: test_elvi(): tweak sed regex

2011-10-10  Shain Singh <shain.singh@gmail.com>

	* New elvi: f5, cisco

2011-10-10  Jason Ryan  <jasonwryan@gmail.com>

	* Added test for priberam.

2011-07-11  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* netbsd: fix normal & mail search.
	  google custom searches were complaining I was a bot, so I
	  switched to normal google searches with
	  site:{mail-index,}.netbsd.org.
	* cia: fix search URL

2011-06-17  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* arxiv: fix -scope=author with single-word queries.
	  Thanks to Nikos Apostolakis.
	* btw, note about entry below, netbsd make *does*
	  support '$<', but only in suffix rules.

2011-06-16  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* Fix more make(1) portability problems.
	  Either I am horribly confused or netbsd make
	  (or at least pmake in debian) doesn't support '$<'.
	  Switched to '$?'.
	* Also switched submit-lsm rule to '$?'.
	  Thanks to Kyle Isom.
	* Removed long-obsolete commented-out sourceforge upload rules.

2011-06-15  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* scitopia, worldwidescience: fixed URLs.
	* Fixed make portability problems.
	  We cannot portably combine single suffix rules (foo.IN->foo)
	  and separated dependencies so we have to explicitly specify
	  all the .IN rules. The solution we used for this until now was
	  specific to GNU make.
	* Removed Makefile.include, no longer used.
	* './configure --enable-opensearch' now only controls
	  installation of the (direct) dependencies for opensearch,
	  not opensearch itself, as opensearch now falls back to
	  using a remote reflector if opensearch-discover(1)
	  and opensearch-genquery(1) aren't found.
	* yandex: fix test.

2011-06-14  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* musicbrainz, codesearch, rpmsearch: Fixed URLs, options and
	  tests. The sites have all changed significantly which means
	  both new options and no-longer-supported options.
	  Codesearch has gone all ajaxy, so I've implemented the options
	  via the search string, e.g. adding " package:foo".
	  Disabled codesearch.test, as it now needs javascript.
	  Codesearch on both google.com and google.co.uk was acting up,
	  so I've pointed it at google.fr.
	* Removed filesearching elvi, it now requires a 'Referer:' header
	  to work. There is no browser-portable way to specify a
	  'Refer[r]er:' header, plus we should probably take it as a hint.
	* Tweaked debian packaging.
	* Updated NEWS.

2011-06-13  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* w3link: fixed URLs.

2011-06-10  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* Fixed ctan.
	  Option -doc has been replaced by -id.
	  Options are no longer mutually exclusive,
	  you can now do (eg) ctan -d -i -n texlive.

2011-06-09  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* fixed tests: debwiki, ntrs, wayback.

2011-06-07  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* Default to surfraw_graphical_remote=no,
	  as chromium doesn't support "-remote openURL".

2011-05-31  Jason Ryan  <jasonwryan@gmail.com>

	* Add options to archpkg.

2011-05-12  Sara Fauzia  <sara@archlinux.us>

	* Fix archpkg URL.

2011-05-12  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* surfraw.IN:
	  + if elvi doesn't exist, send usage to stderr not stdout.
	  + bookmark names: do exact match not substring match.
	* Added tests for archwiki, deli & stack.
	* README:
	  + added INTEGRATION section on uzbl and pentadactyl.
	  + upcased section headings for clarity.

2011-05-12  Jason Ryan  <jasonwryan@gmail.com>

	* New elvi:
	  + archwiki: search the arch wiki.
	  + deli: search delicious.com.
	  + stack: search stackoverflow.com and friends.

2011-03-21  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* google: Added -safe=default|off|moderate|strict
	  option for Safe Search.

2011-03-21  Ivy Foster  <joyfulgirl@archlinux.us>

	* Added Google Translate to elvi/translate.

2011-03-03  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* opensearch: new option -r, uses redirector at
	  http://erislabs.net/ianb/webtools/opensearch/ instead of calling
	  opensearch-discover and opensearch-genquery. -r is selected
	  automatically if those tools are not installed. This enables us
	  to ship opensearch in the main surfraw package and it still
	  functions if the dependencies are not installed. See
	  debian/changelog.
	* wikipedia: new options:
	  + -d, uses a redirector at http://erislabs.net/ianb/webtools/wpdp/
	    This redirector searches for a page with that name at wikipedia.
 	    If not found, it searches deletionpedia, if not found there
	    it falls back to a normal wikipedia search.
	  + -f=w|d, -fallback=wikipedia|deletionpedia
	    Implies -d. If page not found at either wikipedia or deletionpedia,
            whether to fallback to wikipedia search or deletionpedia search.
	* google:
	  + support video, maps and news.
	  + new options -i, -v, -m, -n, shortcuts for
	    -search={images,videos,maps,news}.
	* debcontents, debpackages: update docs for new arches and
	  distributions.
	* bugzilla:
	  + fix url so it works with redhat & eclipse bugzillas too.
	  + enable -s=redhat.
	* ixquick, w3css: fix tests.
	* opensearch, wikipedia: add redirector tests.

2011-02-20  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* New elvi: bugzilla - searches various bugzillas,
	  defaults to kernel.
	* pgpkeys: add more options, support more
	  keyservers, default to sks-keyservers.net.

	  args with spaces.
	* debbugs: add -s as an alias for -search=src.
	* surfraw.IN: (finally) update copyright year to 2011.
	* remove traces of port elvi from build system.

2011-02-09  Kyle Isom <coder@kyleisom.net>

	* arxiv: Thanks to MT <mt_void@warpmail.net> for patch that fixes:
	  1. Search queries with more than two terms would fail, e.g.
	    'supermassive black hole'.
	  2. Full text search was broken, it works now.
	  3. Enhancement: quoting the query now does an exact string match.

2010-10-29  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* wayback: advanced search is broken, rip out all
	  options and use basic search.
	* w3_url_escape: add /g to '/'->'%2F' replacement.
	* uzbl_load_url_from_surfraw: use @AWK@ to pick up
	  ./configure's choice of awk implementation.

2010-10-28  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* Support -local-help, --local-help or -lh to get elvi-specific
	  help without displaying the global options. This works for
	  all elvi and the main surfraw script.
	* google, duckduckgo, opensearch, wayback: tweak overbroad
	  option parsing so it doesn't interfere with -lh.
	* Support -h as a synonym for -help.

2010-10-25  Ian Beckwith  <ianb@erislabs.net>

	* new elvi: scirus, scitopia, worldwidescience.

	  + Applied patch from Sumant Oemrawsingh to strip "GLOBAL ELVI"
	    and "LOCALELVI" and support vertical menus if patched dmenu is

	  + present_menu(): use awk(1) instead of cut(1), so tabs in
