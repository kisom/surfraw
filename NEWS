Mon Jun 16 11:52:41 BST 2008  - surfraw 2.2.2

  * New elvis:
    + arxiv - Search the Los Alamos Science E-Print Archive
      replaces xxx which was just a stub (thanks to John Gruenenfelder).
    + javasun - search Java API Docs (thanks to James TD Smith)
  * Fixed elvis:
    + wetandwild: switched to weather.com, as yahoo now uses AJAX.
      Command line options and SURFRAW_weather_* variables no
      longer supported.
    + austlii: fixed search URL, default method is now 'auto'.
    + port: original site is back.
    + translate: fixed URLs.
  * Removed elvis:
    + sundocs: use sunonesearch.
    + xxx: replaced by arxiv.
  * surfraw-update-path: fix csh syntax (thanks John Gruenenfelder)
  * google: Add -country option to specify country. Respects
    SURFRAW_lang variable (Thanks to James TD Smith).

Sun Mar  9 19:24:26 GMT 2008  - surfraw 2.2.1

  * New elvi:
    + lsm - Search the Linux Software Map.
    + sunonesearch - Search Sun's One Search (replaces sunsolve).
  * Fixed elvi: cddb, cnn, debcontents, deblists, debpackages, freedb,
    fsfdir, genpkg, and yubnub (thanks for the latter to Nathaniel Heinrichs).
  * Removed elvis: sunsolve (replaced by sunonesearch).
  * amazon, ebay, translate: expanded language/country list.
  * Added new configuration variable SURFRAW_lang.
    Elvi that support specifying language or country
    will use this as a default. If used, it should be set
    to an ISO 2-letter country code (eg uk, de, ca).
    Thanks to Simon Ernst for the idea.
  * Fixed quoting single quotes in URLs (thanks to Alexander
    Becher for the patch).

Thu Sep  6 21:59:35 BST 2007 - surfraw 2.2.0

  * Resumed making upstream releases.
    Surfraw is now maintained by the Debian Surfraw-Devel Team. Please
    report bugs to <surfraw-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>, and feel
    free to join us on the list.

    There have been many changes since the last official release.

    New elvi: alioth archpkg bbcnews cddb cia codesearch ctan cve
    	      deblists deblogs debpts debsec debwiki discogs dmoz ebay
    	      etym foldoc freedb fsfdir genpkg gutenberg happypenguin
    	      imdb ixquick lastfm leodict musicbrainz opensearch
    	      pgpkeys port rae rfc scholar scpan w3css w3html w3link
    	      w3rdf wayback wikipedia yubnub

    Removed elvi: appwatch britannica ftpfind ftpsearch jake
    	    	  raging swhois

    Elvi now live in /usr/lib/surfraw (or /usr/local/lib/surfraw)
    Use surfraw-update-path to add this directory to your path or
    prefix elvi with sr or surfraw, eg "sr google foo bar".

    Bookmarks can be defined in /etc/surfraw.bookmarks or
    ~/.surfraw.bookmarks. See /etc/surfraw.bookmarks for the format.
    Bookmarks can be used with "sr [options] bookmarkname".

    There is now a test suite. "make test" to run it or
    see test/README.

    For a full list of changes since the last release, see
    debian/changelog. From this release onwards, changes will be
    logged in ./ChangeLog as normal.

Tur Mar 30 01:21:03 CEST 2004 - surfraw 2.0.2

  * Added bash completion support by Justin B Rye
  * Do not set $DISPLAY when running in text mode
  * Removed sharereactor elvi

Tue Feb 10 04:01:40 GMT 2004 - surfraw 2.0.1

Please note that the elvi have moved again, to /usr/lib/surfraw

If you used surfraw-update-path from version 2.0 to add the elvi
directory to your path, you will need to run it again, first with
-remove to remove the old path, then again with -add. To change your
path you will need to either log out and in again or source the
relevant config files.

  * Moved elvi to /usr/lib/surfraw
  * Updated docs for new elvi location
  * Changed man page section for all elvi to 1sr
  * Fixed surfraw help text
  * Added man page links for pgpkeys, ebay and sharereactor

    (they were in released 2.0-1 but not CVS)

    Both go via autoconf.

    specified minimum automake version 1.7
  * updated surfraw.lsm with new URLs
  * deleted debian/rules.save (old rules backup)
  * Removed elvi:
    + britannica: gone subscription-only
    + swhois: all whois sites I can find have anti-harvester features
	  that stop us using them.
  * Fixed elvi:
    + wikipedia - added missing quotes (could've sworn I did this already)
    + cnn - updated url
    + translate - corrected docs
  * Moved debian/surfraw.links to links.IN in top dir, now uses autoconf
    and is not debian-specific
  * Makefile.am: Added install-data-hook to create links
  * configure.in, elvi/Makefile.in: fixed ELVIDIR quoting
  * added elvi/surfraw_elvi to CLEANFILES & removed it from cvs, as it is
    generated on build.
  * disabled ifs quoting in elvi that don't like it:
    freedb, happypenguin, jake, rhyme, scaleplus, 
	sharereactor, thesaurus, webster, deblists.
  * Added note to HACKING explaining how to disable ifs quoting
  * synced NAMESPACE branch with HEAD
    Please use the main HEAD branch from now on.
  * links.IN: made links relative
  * Converted debconf to po-debconf
  * Eliminated templates.IN, as it confused po-debconf
